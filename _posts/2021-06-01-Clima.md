> Rethinking how we view a large cluster of data.

Data visualization is beginning to become very prevalent in the world of design. In this emerging field, graphical representations are created for depicting a quick summary of data collections. 
Code can be an efficient tool in mapping those depictions, which could save designers from carrying out the mundane operation of defining every single connection. 

In my first effort to enter the world of data visualization, I used a combination of Javascript & Illustrator to map annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and average temperature data from North America between 1914 and 2013 to the diameter and color (respectively) of a grid of circles. 

The final result was a 24x36 printed poster. This exercise was inspired by an [article](https://medium.com/re-write/combining-illustrator-and-javascript-for-data-visualization-dbe825852178) I found on Medium written by Nick Balderston.

## Research

I found data for annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and average temperatures in North America using the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/united-states?country=~USA)  website, as well as the [Climate.gov](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature). I then converted exported CSV files to XML inorder to refine my dataset. I saved separate XML files for emissions and temperatures to the folder in which I saved my first ExtendScript Toolkit file.

## Digital Visualization

Part Two of this exercise was to create a proof of concept for the utilization of this data visualization on an online platform. I decided that an interesting way to view this visualization would be mobily and created the prototype app Clima.
